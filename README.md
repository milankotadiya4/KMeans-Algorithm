# K-means Clustering

The k-means clustering method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset. There are many different types of clustering methods, but k-means is one of the oldest and most approachable. These traits make implementing k-means clustering in Python reasonably straightforward, even for novice programmers and data scientists.

If you’re interested in learning how and when to implement k-means clustering in Python, then this is the right place. You’ll walk through an end-to-end example of k-means clustering using Python, from preprocessing the data to evaluating results.
